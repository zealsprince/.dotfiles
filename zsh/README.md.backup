# zsh Configuration #

The main zsh configuration I use on all systems I run and manage.

## Installation ##

### Quick start (recommended)

Use the provided setup script:

- Preview what it will do:

  `./setup.sh --all`

- Apply changes:

  `./setup.sh --all --apply`

Notes:
- On systems where dotfiles are deployed via another tool (e.g. Home Manager), you may not want `--install-dotfiles`. In that case, use:
  `./setup.sh --install-omz --install-plugins --apply`

### Manual install

Before doing anything else: Make sure you have *zsh* and *oh-my-zsh* installed.
You should be able to download zsh through your system's package manager. For
the installation of *oh-my-zsh*, head over to the
[official GitHub repository](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) or
check the *.zshrc* file for additional instructions on the command line.

Override your *.zshrc* file with the one in this repository.

To install plugins used by this setup, you can either:
- run `./setup.sh --install-plugins --apply`, or
- review and run `plugins.sh` manually (it clones plugin repos into Oh My Zsh’s custom directories).

Additionally for my powerlevel10k settings; copy the `.p10k.zsh` file to your
home directory (or let `./setup.sh --install-dotfiles --apply` link it).

## Troubleshooting ##

In some rare cases you might receive the following message after starting zsh.

    compdef: unknown command or service: [application name]

If this error applies to you, make sure that the application/command/service
is installed on your system. With that said, if the error still occurs run
the following command to possibly fix it.

    $ rm -f ~/.zcompdump*; compinit

This will reset zsh's command completion configuration and re-initilize it.
