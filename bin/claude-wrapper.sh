# claude-wrapper version: 6
#
# Vendored from https://github.com/yacb2/claude-restart (scripts/claude-wrapper.sh).
# Installed by hand instead of install.sh: ~/.zshrc is a read-only Nix store
# symlink and the claude-* launchers exec this directly. Only local change:
# the session-size lookup follows CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR instead of ~/.claude.
#
# Unified wrapper for claude-restart and claude-session-handoff.
#
# Runs claude normally. After each exit, checks per-PID flag files in
# ~/.claude/tmp/ and decides what to do next:
#
#   handoff-flag-<pid>  -> launch a fresh session (SessionStart hook injects payload)
#   restart-flag-<pid>  -> resume the same session with --resume <id>
#   (none)              -> exit
#
# If both flags are present, handoff wins (a fresh session takes precedence
# over resuming an old one).
#
# Each wrapper instance is identified by its PID, exported as both
# CLAUDE_RESTART_ID and CLAUDE_HANDOFF_ID so hooks from either tool work.
#
# Exit trigger (v4+): instead of killing the wrapper from inside claude
# (which forced the model to emit `kill`, a primitive the new sandbox/
# automode classifier escalates regardless of the allowlist), the skill/
# hook now `touch`es a per-PID sentinel:
#
#   handoff-exit-<pid>  -> background watcher signals SIGTERM to claude
#
# The watcher is launched alongside each claude invocation, polls the
# sentinel, and is the only process that ever calls `kill`. The skill side
# only needs `touch`, which is benign.
#
# v6 pays the two debts that backgrounding claude had quietly incurred:
# its stdin and its exit status. See `exec 3<&0` and LAST_CLAUDE_EXIT below.
#
# POSIX-compatible (sh, bash, zsh, dash).
#
# This file is co-owned by:
#   - https://github.com/yacb2/claude-restart
#   - https://github.com/user/claude-session-handoff  (rename as published)
# Both installers write the highest version they ship; the file is byte-for-byte
# identical across repos.

# Hold the wrapper's own stdin on fd 3 so claude can be given it explicitly.
#
# run_claude backgrounds claude to run the exit watcher alongside it, and POSIX
# assigns /dev/null to the stdin of an asynchronous list when job control is
# off — which it is in a script — so `cat notes.md | claude -p …` reached claude
# with no input and no error. Since the rc block replaces `claude` globally,
# that was every piped or redirected use, not just the handoff flow.
#
# The rule applies only "before any explicit redirections", so `<&3` at the
# launch site wins. `0<&0` would not: a self-dup is exactly the form a shell may
# treat as a no-op.
